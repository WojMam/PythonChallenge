## Topics
This is the list of the applications that are done until now:

1. Guessing Game
2. Exchange calculator [in-progress]

## Technology

Technologies used in the projects:

- [Python] - This on is obvious, right? :bowtie:
- [markdown-it] - It's not popular in the IT world, but I like to create documentation :boom:

file included in the each project localization.
